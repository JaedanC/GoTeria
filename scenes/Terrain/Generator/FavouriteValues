Simplex Line:
	1:
		px: 2000x300
		Octaves: 5
		Period: 550
		Persistence: 0.5
		Height: 200
		Offset: -135
		Comment: This provides very nice macro overworld heightmap that can be used
			as the basis for more world generation in the future
		Time: <500ms
	2:
		Octaves: 6
		Period: 20
		Height: 40
		Comment: This wave is a good basis for the top of the underworld

Black And White(Overlay(Gradient Down, Simplex Noise))
	1:
		px: 1000x200
		Gradient Down:
			Top Threshold: 60
			Bottom Threshold: 150
		Simplex Noise:
			Octaves: 4
			Period: 50
			Persistence: 0.5
		Black And White:
			Threshold: 0.5
		Comment: This is an overworld function that creates realistic overhangs.
			This could be combined with a more macro overworld shape to produce
			a final result.
		Time: <500ms

Cave Sticker Algorithm
	1:
		px: 500x500
		Octaves: 0
		Period: 1
		Persistence: 0.4
		DrunkardWalk:
			Drunkards: 1 (or 2)
			Steps: 1000
		GeneratedCaveStickers: 170
		NumCaveStickers: GeneratedCaveStickers
		Comment: This generates caves by simulating 'GeneratedCaveStickers'
			drunkard walks. Then, they are copied to the final image in a
			random location. The current algorithm places cave stickers favoured
			away from x=0 and y=0 so that will need to be changed. Also, the
			place_cave_stickers algorithm does not randomly choose stickers
			which it can do. Consider changing this also. The generation of cave
			stickers could be done using a threadpool.
		Time: ~4s

Merge(Black And White(Simplex Noise), Cave Sticker Algorithm #1)
	1:
		px: 500x500
		Simplex Noise:
			Octaves: 4
			Period: 50
			Persistence: 0.5
		Black And White:
			Threshold: 0.65
		Cave Sticker Algorithm #1:
			GeneratedCaveStickers: 100
		Comment: This introduces additional random caves that are much smoother
			to the eye in random locations. The amount of Cave sticker is
			reduced to account for the additional caves.
		Time: ~2.5s
