    "A Fast Voxel Traversal Algorithm for Ray Tracing"
    http://www.cse.chalmers.se/edu/year/2010/course/TDA361/grid.pdf
    By John Amanatides, Andrew Woo

    "A fast and simple voxel traversal algorithm through a 3D [also 2D] space partition is
    introduced. Going from one voxel to its neighbour requires only two floating point
    comparisons and one floating point addition. Also, multiple ray intersections with
    objects that are in more than one voxel are eliminated."
